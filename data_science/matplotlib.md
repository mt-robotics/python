- Strengths:
  - Very flexible and customizable.
  - Can create almost any kind of plot.
  - Large community and extensive documentation.

- Weaknesses:
  - Sometimes can be more complex and code-heavy for simple plots.
  - Default aesthetics can be basic and may require customization to look modern.
